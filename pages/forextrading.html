                </div>
                <div class="answer active">
                    <p>Most traders start their forex career with hopes of getting rich, but is that truly possible? As with any type of investing, there are risks, of course, and the best way to get rich is to start with a large amount of capital. Forex trading can be a real struggle, and data shows that more than two-thirds of forex traders don't make money in any given year. Yet of the one-third that make money, some are indeed getting rich. If that's your hope too, then be sure to safeguard your account by using stop-losses, limiting your leverage, and using a reputable forex broker like MantaTrade.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>MantaTrade offers a forex mini-account where you can start your trading journey with as little as $100. It's an excellent way to become familiar with the markets and begin learning about your trading style. You may not get rich, but you will get some valuable trading experience in live market conditions that can't be replaced, even by demo trading. In addition, you should begin developing some profitable strategies for trading the forex markets. If you have limited funds starting out this way can be your entryway to some of the most exciting markets.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Forex trading can be challenging when you're just starting, but as time goes by and you gain more experience, it becomes easier. The early difficulties are simply the learning curve as you understand the jargon, how to use the trading platforms, begin studying technical and fundamental analysis, and everything else that goes along with trading forex. As time goes by, many of these things become second nature, and forex trading becomes much less complicated. It might never become easy, but nothing worth having is ever easy.</p>
