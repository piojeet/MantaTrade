                        Trading platforms are generally categorized into two broad types: proprietary (prop) trading
                        platforms and commercial trading platforms. Large financial brokerage firms design prop trading
                        platforms to meet their trading style and electronic brokerage needs. On the other hand,
                        commercial
                        trading platforms target retail investors and day traders and are typically user-friendly and
                        packed
                        with useful features, such as news feeds and interactive charts, to enhance investor research
                        and
                        analysis.</p> <br>
                    <p class="discription-sm">Commercial platforms come in different forms, helping to meet the

                        <p class="discription-sm">Manual online trading platforms give traders access to the financial
                            markets, where they can manually
                            open, close, and manage their trading positions. In retail trading, the MantaTrade platforms
                            (MT4
                            and MT5) are the most popular and probably, best trading platforms. They are easy to use and
                            feature
                            many handy tools and resources to allow retail investors to trade financial assets
                            professionally.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="discription-sm">On the other hand, automated trading platforms use technology to allow
                            investors to trade the markets
                            mechanically. Some manual platforms, such as MT4 and MT5, support automated trading
                            functionality.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="discription-sm">However, retail traders' most common automated trading platforms are
                            social or copy trading
                            platforms, such DupliTrade and ZuluTrade. On these platforms, traders have the option of
                            perfectly
                            replicating the trade positions of expert or successful traders on their community or

                        <p class="discription-sm">CFD trading platforms allow investors to speculate on the price
                            changes of financial assets without
                            taking any ownership. For instance, on the MT5 platform, traders can trade Bitcoin CFDs
                            according to
                            market conditions but never own the digital assets. CFD trading platforms have grown in
                            popularity
                            in recent years because they provide easy and convenient access to opportunities in the
                            financial
                            world. </p>

                        <p class="discription-sm">On the other hand, options trading platforms provide investors with a
                            platform to trade call and put
                            options effectively. Vanilla options are derivatives that give investors the right to buy or
                            sell a
                            financial security at a specified time and date. </p>

                            trading platform. PC/Mac
                            platforms are software that can only be installed on a desktop computer. Mobile platforms
                            are
                            software installed on Android/iOS mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. In
                            contrast,
                            web-based platforms can be accessed directly on an internet-connected browser, whether the

                                            will include such features as stop losses and pending order types. Because
